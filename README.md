* Staff Software Engineer at Nearform
* Blogging at [jameslmilner.com](https://www.jameslmilner.com) and tweeting [sometimes](https://www.twitter.com/jameslmilner)
* Working on [Terra Draw](https://www.github.com/jameslmilner/terra-draw) - a map drawing library that works across different mapping providers
* Occasionally trying to help out with [turfjs](https://www.github.com/turfjs/turf) when I can
